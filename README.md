# Usage
## Entity
Entities are are Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) and nothing else. Entities can be instantiated directly and then added to the manager:
```python
entity_manager = EntityManager()
entity = Entity()
entity_manager.add_entity(entity)
```
or both in one step with `EntityManager.create_entity()`:
```python
entity = entity_manager.create_entity()
```

## EntityManager
The entity manager is responsible for handling entities, their components and systems. It is essentially a database of all entities and systems and is the link between entities and their components.  
You will usually want to create an instance of an `EntityManager`:
```python
entity_manager = EntityManager()
```
...And call its `update()` function every tick. This updates all of the Systems registered with the Entity Manager.
Entities are not registered in the entity manager database at all unless they have components attached to them.

Because components aren't directly attached to entities (only through the entity manager), components become detached from an entity the moment it is removed from the manager. Thus, removed entities that are then re-added to the manager will no longer have their components unless you handle this yourself.

### deltatime
`EntityManager.update()` takes a parameter `deltatime` which is a measurement of time between frames. You can utilise this however you like for framerate independence.

## Component
Components are simply data holders and nothing more. You should inherit the `Component` class when writing components. Components should not contain logic and should only contain data.  
An example position component class in a 2d game could be:
```python
class PositionComponent(Component):  
	def __init__(self):
		self.x = 0
		self.y = 0
```
However you might prefer to use private attributes with getter/setter functions.
### Adding and Removing Components
You can add and remove components from entities dynamically through the Entity Manager:
```python
entity = Entity()
entity_manager = EntityManager()
entity_manager.add_component_to_entity(entity, PositionComponent())
entity_manager.remove_component_from_entity(entity, PositionComponent)
```
Notice that you must provide a `Component` instance when adding a component but only need provide a `Component` type when removing one.
## System
Systems are for processing specific sets of entities. You should inherit the `System` class when writing systems. The `update()` method of your system is called every tick and should perform your logic, usually iterating through a `Family`. A `Family` is ensentially a set of `Entity` instances and should be assigned in the constructor.  
Usually in a System you want to only perform logic on entities that have a specific Component type or set of Component types. For example, a movement system might only affect entities that have a position component and a velocity component, we use families to hold these for us, and we can obtain a `Family` of entities by using `get_family` from an `EntityManager` instance.
Then, you would want to work with the components of the entities, so use `EntityManager`'s `get_component_map()` to get all components of a type so you can access a `Component` by using an `Entity` as the key.  
Here's how it might look:
```python
class MovementSystem(System):
	def __init__(self, entity_manager):
		super().__init__()
		# Get the Family of entities with position and velocity components:
		self.family = entity_manager.get_family((PositionComponent, VelocityComponent))
		# Get the component maps so we can access the components using the entity as a key:
		self.movement_component_map = entity_manager.get_component_map(MovementComponent)
		self.position_component_map = entity_manager.get_component_map(PositionComponent)
		
	def update(self, deltatime):
		for entity in self.family:
			position = self.position_component_map[entity]
			velocity = self.velocity_component_map[entity]
			position.x += velocity.x * deltatime
			position.y += velocity.y * deltatime
```
Then, you can add an instance of this system to the Entity Manager:
```python
movement_system = MovementSystem()
entity_manager.add_system(movement_system)
```
Systems can also be removed dynamically:
```python
entity_manager.remove_system(movement_system)
```

### IteratorSystem

Most systems will involve iterating over a `family`. To avoid redundant code, stup-ecs provides a handy utility class which will do this for you, called `IteratorSystem`.

In the constructor of your `System`, get the `Family` of entities as you normally would:

```python
self.family = entity_manager.get_family((PositionComponent, VelocityComponent))
```

Rather than overriding the `Update()` function, override `Iterator System`'s `Process()`function to do your logic and it will be applied to all entities in the family. The `MovementSystem` from before would look like this:

```python
class MovementSystem(IteratorSystem):
	def __init__(self, entity_manager):
		super().__init__()
		# Get the Family of entities with position and velocity components:
		self.family = entity_manager.get_family((PositionComponent, VelocityComponent))
		# Get the component maps so we can access the components using the entity as a key:
		self.movement_component_map = entity_manager.get_component_map(MovementComponent)
		self.position_component_map = entity_manager.get_component_map(PositionComponent)		

	def process(self, deltatime, entity):
		position = self.position_component_map[entity]
		velocity = self.velocity_component_map[entity]
		position.x += velocity.x * deltatime
		position.y += velocity.y * deltatime
```

## EntityListener

Entity listeners can be registered with an `EntityManager` instance. Listeners get notified whenever an entity is added or removed from the manager. This is useful if you want to do something upon one of those events.

To write your own listener, inherit the `EntityListener` class. You must override the abstract methods `entity_added` and `entity_removed` but any that aren't required can just `pass`.

For the purpose of example the following class will print the entity object when it is removed from the manager.

```python
class PrintListener(EntityListener):
    def entity_added(self, entity):
        pass

    def entity_removed(self, entity, components):
        print(entity)
```

`entity_added` takes the added entity as a parameter, whereas `entity_removed` additionally takes the components that were attached to the entity in the system so that you can utilise them in your listener.

You must register a listener with an `ÃˆntityManager` instance for it to function. You can do so like this:

```python
entity_manager = EntityManager()
print_listener = PrintListener()
entity_manager.add_listener(print_listener)
```

You can removed listeners from the manager, too:
```python
entity_manager.remove_listener(print_listener)
```
